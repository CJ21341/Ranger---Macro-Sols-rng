A Sols rng macro i made, i took a little inspiration of MultiScope. 
It's very Easy to use, And your config file has to be in the same path with the macro or it'll not load the settings.

You have to pip install pydirectinput Customtkinter pyautogui in your cmd or the macro will not work.

It's very easy to use
